      <description>Spiral Safe introduces a modern approach to this problem. We offer a semi-custodial solution that integrates natively with all browsers, utilizing biometrics, FaceID, and other device-supported authentication methods. At the heart of our solution is a secure vault storage system that ensures private keys are never exposed. Transactions are signed on-the-fly by the vault, only after authenticating the user through their device&amp;rsquo;s biometric or other authentication methods.
Our solution is further bolstered by a plugin we&amp;rsquo;ve developed that integrates seamlessly with HashiCorp Vault.</description>

This plugin facilitates client registration and signs transactions on their behalf. While the core code is open-sourced, we&amp;rsquo;ve also introduced a service layer that allows businesses to integrate these functionalities with ease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>The current landscape of web3 onboarding is fraught with complications. Most users access the web through phone browsers, which aren&amp;rsquo;t natively integrated with public chains. Existing solutions necessitate installing extensions, secondary wallets, or in-wallet browsers. Users are often overwhelmed by the intricacies of seed phrase security, and the choice between trusting a centralized entity or navigating the complexities of decentralized seed phrases. Furthermore, while there are attempts to produce phones with integrated enclaves, hardware adoption presents its own set of challenges.</description>
